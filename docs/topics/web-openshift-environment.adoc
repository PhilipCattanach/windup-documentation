= Understanding the {WebNameTitle} OpenShift Image

Red Hat offers containerized images for {ProductShortName} that are designed for use with OpenShift. Using these images developers can quickly and easily manage migration projects and analyze applications.

The OpenShift images include three separate pods:

* The executor, responsible for running the analysis and generating the reports
* The {WebName} interface and SSO, which provide access to the web console itself
* The PostgreSQL database, which stores the project's configuraton and analysis tracking information

A separate persistent volume is used for the {WebName} interface and the PostgreSQL pods; however, the executor's storage is dependent on the template used.

* The `web-template-empty-dir-executor.json` is the recommended template. It configures the executor pod to use temporary storage on a single machine, and has no defined persistent volume. The analysis data is sent between the executor and web console pods using a RESTful web service.

* The `web-template-empty-dir-executor-shared-storage.json` is an alternative template available for use. This template configures the executor pod and the web console pod to use a shared persistent volume. All instances of these pods read and write to the same persistent volume, mounted as `ReadWriteMany` in OpenShift.

== OpenShift Template Environment Variables

The OpenShift image environment variables are configured as a baseline for application analysis, and work well in a variety of environments. No additional configuration is required to perform an analysis.

The most common environment variables modified are the CPU and memory resources allocated to each image. These contain a pattern of `__NODE_NAME__` followed by `REQUESTED___RESOURCE__`. For instance, `EXECUTOR_REQUESTED_CPU` indicates the number of CPU cores to request for the executor pod, while `EXECUTOR_REQUESTED_MEMORY` indicates the amount of memory to request for the executor pod.

All of the environment variables are found within each template, along with a description of each.
