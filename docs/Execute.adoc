==== Overview 

These instructions use the replaceable variable `{ProductHomeVar}` to refer to the fully qualified path to your {ProductShortName} installation. For more information, see xref:About-the-HOME-Variable[About the {ProductHomeVar} Variable].

[[run-windup]]
==== Run {ProductShortName}  

. Open a terminal and navigate to the {ProductHomeVar} directory. 
. The command to run {ProductShortName} uses the following syntax.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
For Linux:     $ bin/windup --input INPUT_ARCHIVE --output OUTPUT_REPORT --packages PACKAGE_1 PACKAGE_2 PACKAGE_N
For Windows:   > bin\windup.bat --input INPUT_ARCHIVE --output OUTPUT_REPORT --packages PACKAGE_1 PACKAGE_2 PACKAGE_N
----

. This command takes arbitrary options processed by different add-ons. The list of options in the core {ProductShortName} distribution can be found in the http://windup.github.io/windup/docs/latest/javadoc/org/jboss/windup/config/ConfigurationOption.html[Javadoc]. Most commonly used command line arguments are:

+
--input *INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_FOLDER*:: This is the fully qualified path of the application archive or folder you plan to migrate.
+
--output *OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY* (optional):: This is the fully qualified path to the folder that will contain the the report information produced by {ProductShortName}. 
+
* If omitted, the report will be generated in a  *INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_FOLDER.report* folder. 
* If the output directory exists, you will see the following error. 
+
----
***ERROR*** Files exist in /home/username/OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY, but --overwrite not specified. Aborting!
----
+
You must specify the `--overwrite` argument to proceed. This forces {ProductShortName} to delete and recreate the folder.
+
[WARNING]
====
Be careful not to specify a report output directory that contains important information!
====
+
--source (optional):: One or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate from. 
+
[TIP]
====
For the list of the available `--source` servers or frameworks, use the `--listSourceTechnologies` argument on the `windup` command line as in the following example.
[options="nowrap"]
----
bin/windup --listSourceTechnologies
----
====
+
--target (optional):: One or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate to.
+
[TIP]
====
For the list of the available `--target` servers or frameworks, use the `--listTargetTechnologies` argument on the `windup` command line as in the following example.
[options="nowrap"]
----
bin/windup --listTargetTechnologies
----
====
+
--overwrite (optional):: Specify this optional argument only if you are certain you want to force {ProductShortName} to delete the existing *OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY* folder. The default value is `false`.
+
--userRulesDirectory (optional):: The fully qualified path to a user directory containing custom XML rules that should be loaded and executed by {ProductShortName}. The XML ruleset files must use one of the following extensions:  [x-]`*.windup.groovy` or [x-]`*.windup.xml`.
+
--packages *PACKAGE_1*, *PACKAGE_2*, *PACKAGE_N* (optional):: This is a comma-delimited list of the packages to be evaluated by {ProductShortName}.
+
* In most cases, you are interested only in evaluating the custom application class packages and not the standard Java EE or 3rd party packages. For example, if the _MyCustomApp_ application uses the package `com.mycustomapp`, you provide that package using the `--packages` argument on the command line. 
* It is not necessary to provide the standard Java EE packages, like `java.util` or `javax.ejb`. 
* While you can provide package names for standard Java EE 3rd party software like `org.apache`, it is usually best not to include them as they should not impact the migration effort.
+
WARNING: If you omit the `--packages` argument, every package in the application is scanned, resulting in very slow performance. It is best to provide the argument with one or more packages.

+
--excludePackages *PACKAGE_1*, *PACKAGE_2*, *PACKAGE_N* (optional):: This is a comma-delimited list of the packages to be excluded by {ProductShortName}.
+
--sourceMode (optional):: This argument is optional and is only required if the application to be evaluated contains source files rather than compiled binaries. The default value is `false`.

. To override the default _Fernflower_ decompiler, pass the `-Dwindup.decompiler` argument on the command line. For example, to use the _Procyon_ compiler, use the following syntax:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
bin/windup -Dwindup.decompiler=procyon INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_FOLDER --output OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY --packages PACKAGE_1 PACKAGE_2 PACKAGE_N 
----

. To evaluate an application archive, use the following syntax:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
bin/windup --input INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_FOLDER --output OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY --packages PACKAGE_1 PACKAGE_2 PACKAGE_N 
----
+
To run {ProductShortName} against application source code, you must add the `--sourceMode` argument:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
bin/windup  --sourceMode --source SOURCE_TECHNOLOGY --target TARGET_TECHNOLOGY --input INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_FOLDER --output OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY --packages PACKAGE_1 PACKAGE_2 PACKAGE_N 
----
+
See xref:command-examples[{ProductShortName} Command Examples] below for concrete examples of commands that use source code directories and archives located in the {ProductShortName} GitHub repository.

. You should see the following result upon completion of the command:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
**SUCCESS*** Windup report created: PATH_TO_REPORTS/index.html
              Access it at this URL: file:///home/username/PATH_TO_REPORTS/index.html
----
+
WARNING: Depending on the size of the application and the hardware {ProductShortName} is running on, this command can take a very long time. For tips on how to improve performance, see xref:Optimize-Performance[Optimize {ProductShortName} Performance].

.  Open the `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY/index.html` file in a browser to access the report.
The following subdirectories in the `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY` contain the supporting information for the report:

        OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY/
            graph/
            renderedGraph/
            reports/
            stats/
            index.html

. For details on how to evaluate the report data, see xref:Review-the-Report[Review the Report].

==== {ProductShortName} Command Examples

The following examples report against applications located in the {ProductShortName} source https://github.com/windup/windup/tree/master/test-files[test-files] directory.

===== Source Code Example

The following command runs against the https://github.com/windup/windup/tree/master/test-files/seam-booking-5.2[seam-booking-5.2] application source code. It evaluates all `org.jboss.seam` packages and creates a folder named 'seam-booking-report' in the `/home/username/windup-reports/` directory to contain the reporting output.

   bin/windup --sourceMode --input /home/username/windup-source/test-files/seam-booking-5.2/ --output /home/username/windup-reports/seam-booking-report --target eap --packages org.jboss.seam

===== Archive Example

The following command runs against the https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear[jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear] EAR archive. It evaluates all `com.acme` and `org.apache` packages and creates a folder named 'jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear-report' in the `/home/username/windup-reports/` directory to contain the reporting output.

    bin/windup  --input /home/username/windup-source/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear/ --output /home/username/windup-reports/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear-report  --target eap --packages com.acme org.apache


===== {ProductShortName} Quickstart Examples

For more concrete examples, see the {ProductShortName} quickstarts located on GitHub here: https://github.com/windup/windup-quickstarts. If you prefer, you can download the https://github.com/windup/windup-quickstarts/releases/[latest release] ZIP or TAR  distribution of the quickstarts.

The quickstarts provide examples of Java-based and XML-based rules you can run and test using {ProductShortName}. The README instructions provide a step-by-step guide to run the quickstart example. You can also look through the code examples and use them as a starting point for creating your own rules.
